# HSV-masking
This code repository shows how to convert RGB image to HSV format, creating a mask using HSV values and finally applying it.

# Pre-requisites:
- Install python 3 or above (Anaconda distribution provides all the utilities bundled and is suggested for set-up purpose)
- Install opencv in Ananconda using below commands (need to run these commands from Anaconda prompt) :
     1. $ conda update anaconda-navigator
     2. $ conda update navigator-updater
     3. $ conda install -c conda-forge opencv
     
# Software versions used in this project
 - Python 3.8
 - Opencv 4.0.1
 
 # Steps to run the code
 1. Ensure all pre-requisite software setups are complete.
 2. Clone Masking-using-HSV project to your local machine.
 3. Open 'Masking using HSV' ipynb file in your Jupyter notebook.
 4. Ensure images folder is placed in the same directory.
 5. Execute commands under 'Masking using HSV' either using Run on notebook or CTRL+ENTER.
 
 Note: If steps 1 to 5 are followed, then masked image should appear. Read through the comments to understand the code.
